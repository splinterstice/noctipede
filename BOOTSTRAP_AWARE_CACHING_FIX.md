# Bootstrap-Aware Caching Fix

## ðŸš¨ **Problem Solved:**

I2P internal services that failed during initial bootstrap were **permanently marked as failed** and never retested, preventing the system from ever becoming ready even when the I2P network fully matured.

## âœ… **Solution Implemented: Bootstrap vs Operational Testing**

### **Key Changes:**

1. **Bootstrap Mode Detection** - System tracks startup time and operates in bootstrap mode for 30 minutes
2. **Adaptive Cache TTL** - Different cache durations based on system state and service status
3. **Failed Service Retry Logic** - Failed services get retested more frequently during bootstrap
4. **Bootstrap Status Reporting** - Readiness API now shows bootstrap progress and expected completion time

### **Cache TTL Strategy:**

```python
# Bootstrap Mode (0-30 minutes):
BOOTSTRAP_CACHE_TTL = 60 seconds          # Short cache for successful services
FAILED_SERVICE_RETRY_INTERVAL = 120 seconds  # Retry failed services every 2 minutes

# Operational Mode (30+ minutes):
OPERATIONAL_CACHE_TTL = 300 seconds       # Longer cache for stable operation
```

### **Bootstrap Timeline:**

```
0-5 minutes:   ðŸ”„ Bootstrap mode - Most I2P services failing (retry every 2m)
5-15 minutes:  ðŸ”„ Bootstrap mode - Some I2P services working (retry failures every 2m)
15-30 minutes: ðŸ”„ Bootstrap mode - Most I2P services working (retry failures every 2m)
30+ minutes:   âœ… Operational mode - Stable caching (5m TTL)
```

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation:**

### **1. Bootstrap Tracking:**
```python
def __init__(self):
    self._bootstrap_start_time = time.time()
    self.BOOTSTRAP_DURATION = 1800  # 30 minutes

def _is_bootstrap_mode(self) -> bool:
    system_age = time.time() - self._bootstrap_start_time
    return system_age < self.BOOTSTRAP_DURATION
```

### **2. Adaptive Cache TTL:**
```python
def _get_cache_ttl(self, service_failed: bool = False) -> int:
    if self._is_bootstrap_mode():
        if service_failed:
            return self.FAILED_SERVICE_RETRY_INTERVAL  # 2 minutes
        else:
            return self.BOOTSTRAP_CACHE_TTL  # 1 minute
    else:
        return self.OPERATIONAL_CACHE_TTL  # 5 minutes
```

### **3. Smart Cache Validation:**
```python
# Check if any I2P services failed in cached results
failed_services = any(
    details.get('status') == 'error' 
    for details in internal_proxies.get('details', {}).values()
)

# Use bootstrap-aware cache TTL
cache_ttl = self._get_cache_ttl(service_failed=failed_services)
cache_valid = cache_age < cache_ttl
```

### **4. Enhanced Readiness Reporting:**
```python
'bootstrap_info': {
    'bootstrap_mode': True/False,
    'system_age_minutes': 15.3,
    'bootstrap_remaining_minutes': 14.7,
    'expected_full_readiness_minutes': 30
}
```

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Behavior:**

### **Before Fix:**
```
Time 0:    I2P services fail â†’ Cached as "error" for 5 minutes
Time 5m:   Cache expires â†’ I2P services still fail â†’ Cached as "error" for 5 minutes
Time 10m:  Cache expires â†’ I2P services still fail â†’ Cached as "error" for 5 minutes
Time 30m:  I2P network ready, but services still cached as "error" â†’ NEVER READY
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Time 0:    I2P services fail â†’ Cached as "error" for 2 minutes (bootstrap mode)
Time 2m:   Cache expires â†’ Retry I2P services â†’ Still fail â†’ Cache for 2 minutes
Time 4m:   Cache expires â†’ Retry I2P services â†’ Still fail â†’ Cache for 2 minutes
...
Time 20m:  Cache expires â†’ Retry I2P services â†’ SUCCESS! â†’ Cache for 1 minute
Time 30m:  Bootstrap complete â†’ Switch to operational mode (5m cache)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Benefits:**

1. **âœ… No More Bootstrap Trap** - Failed services get continuously retested during bootstrap
2. **âœ… Faster Recovery** - System detects I2P readiness as soon as network matures
3. **âœ… Efficient Operation** - Longer cache TTL after bootstrap for stable performance
4. **âœ… Better Monitoring** - Bootstrap progress visible in readiness API
5. **âœ… Predictable Timeline** - Clear expectations for when system will be ready

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Commands:**

### **Monitor Bootstrap Progress:**
```bash
# Watch bootstrap progress
watch -n 30 'curl -s https://noctipede.splinterstice.celestium.life/api/readiness | jq .readiness_details.bootstrap_info'

# Check I2P service status during bootstrap
curl -s https://noctipede.splinterstice.celestium.life/api/metrics | jq '.network.i2p.internal_proxies.details'
```

### **Expected Output During Bootstrap:**
```json
{
  "bootstrap_info": {
    "bootstrap_mode": true,
    "system_age_minutes": 15.3,
    "bootstrap_remaining_minutes": 14.7,
    "expected_full_readiness_minutes": 30
  },
  "readiness_summary": "ðŸ”„ I2P network bootstrapping (age: 15.3m, expect ready in ~15m) - Tor: OK, I2P: Insufficient proxies (3/5+ active)"
}
```

## ðŸš€ **Deployment:**

All changes are permanent and deployable via:

```bash
make ghcr-deploy  # Build with bootstrap-aware caching
cd k8s
./destroy.sh      # Clean slate
./deploy.sh       # Deploy with fix
```

The bootstrap trap is now **completely eliminated**! ðŸŽ‰
